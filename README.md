# Welcome to the Foodies Fave Queue Management System!

This Java-based project is designed to streamline operations at a food center, managing customer queues and inventory.

The system offers various features to optimize food center operations. It allows for efficient queue management, including adding, removing, and serving customers. Inventory tracking is automated, with stock levels updated as customers are served, and warnings issued when stock runs low. The system also supports data persistence, enabling the saving and loading of queue and inventory data. With a class-based design, the project ensures robustness through the implementation of FoodQueue and Customer classes. Income tracking functionality calculates and displays income per queue, while a waiting list feature handles overflow customers effectively. Additionally, the system supports sorting of customers alphabetically.
